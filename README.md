This repository contains electronic supporting information for the
paper submitted by Alessandro Landi, Daniele Padula and Andrea Peluso

This repository contains electronic supporting information for the paper "Simulation of polymeric mixed ionic and electronic conductors with a combined classical and quantum mechanical model", submitted to J. Mater. Chem. C, doi:?? by A. Landi, M. Reisjalali, J. Elliot, M. Matta, P. Carbone and A. Troisi.

We here provide the LAMMPS input, the torsional potential for the dihedral highlighted in Fig. 2 of the paper and starting topologies for the systems with 25% and 75% charged chains

If using materials from this paper, please acknowledge our work.

In this folder there are gromacs topologies ready to run simulations for the
three molecules studied, as obtained with the Joyce protocol.
Atomic charges are derived from the RESP procedure, while non-bonded parameters
are taken from corresponding OPLS atom types, as specified in the comments.
